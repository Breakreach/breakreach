# Breakreach

Breakreach publishes to 15 networks from one request. The accounts are connected once in Breakreach (or through a connect link), and every post names the accounts it goes to by id.

## 1. Pick the interface

Use the first one that is available:

1. **MCP tools** (`create_post`, `list_accounts`, … sometimes prefixed like `mcp__breakreach__create_post`). Hosted at `https://api.breakreach.com/mcp`, OAuth sign-in.
2. **The CLI**, when you can run shell commands and `BREAKREACH_API_KEY` is set or `npx breakreach login` was done: `npx breakreach accounts`, `npx breakreach post … --json`. See [references/rest-and-cli.md](references/rest-and-cli.md).
3. **The REST API** with `curl` or the SDKs (`npm install breakreach`, `pip install breakreach`), with `Authorization: Bearer $BREAKREACH_API_KEY`. Same reference file.

None of them? Tell the user how to connect, in one or two lines, for their client:

- Claude Code: `claude mcp add --transport http breakreach https://api.breakreach.com/mcp`, then `/mcp` to sign in
- Codex: `codex mcp add breakreach --url https://api.breakreach.com/mcp` (then `codex mcp login breakreach` if no browser opens)
- Cursor: add `{"mcpServers": {"breakreach": {"url": "https://api.breakreach.com/mcp"}}}` to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, then Connect in Settings, Tools & MCP
- claude.ai, ChatGPT: Breakreach is in their connector directories
- Anything else: an API key from Breakreach, Settings → API & MCP (`br_...`), as a Bearer token

A plan or trial is needed to publish; without one, action tools answer with a link to the plans: pass it on.

## 2. Posting, step by step

1. **Accounts.** Call `list_accounts` (pass `workspace` when the user has several; `list_workspaces` lists them with their timezone). Use only ids it returns, never guess one. If the user names a network with two accounts there, ask which. An account with a `warning` must be reconnected in Breakreach settings before it can publish: say so.
2. **When.** Exactly one of:
   - a time the user gave → `scheduledAt`, local ISO time **in the workspace timezone**, no offset: `2026-10-20T09:00:00`. Turn "tomorrow 9am" into a date yourself, and say the date back
   - "whenever", "next slot", a queue → `useNextSlot: true` (the workspace's posting schedule; `get_next_slot` shows it first)
   - "now" → `publishNow: true`
   - the user wants to review, or something is missing (media, a time) → `draft: true`; it waits in Breakreach and is scheduled later with `update_post`
3. **Media.** Public URLs in `media`, in order. Run a URL through `upload_media` first so it's still there when the post goes out. A local file can't go through MCP: upload it with `npx breakreach upload <file>` or `POST /v1/media/upload`, or ask for a link. Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Pinterest need a photo or a video.
4. **Network options** when the post goes there (table below): Pinterest needs `pinterestBoardId` from `list_pinterest_boards`; Reddit takes `redditSubreddit` (else the user's profile); TikTok posts are private (`SELF_ONLY`) unless `tiktokSettings.privacyLevel` says otherwise, so ask when it matters.
5. **Idempotency.** Give every new `create_post` call an `idempotencyKey` (a fresh UUID). If the call times out or errors without an answer and you retry, send the **same** key and the same arguments: Breakreach returns the post it already made instead of publishing twice. A result saying "Already created by an earlier call" means the first call worked. Over REST the key goes in the `Idempotency-Key` header (the SDKs and the CLI handle it).
6. **Report back** in a sentence: what was posted or scheduled, where (the `accounts` of the answer), when in the workspace's time, and the post id. Don't paste the raw JSON.

Posting is public. When the request is clear ("post this on X now"), do it. When the accounts, the time or the text are unclear, ask one short question, or save a draft and say so. Never publish to accounts the user didn't ask for.

### What each network takes

| Network | Post | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instagram | 1 photo (feed), 1 video (Reel), or 2 to 10 photos/videos (carousel, cropped to the first photo's shape) | media. MCP only: `instagramSettings.shareAs: "story"` |
| TikTok | 1 video, or up to 35 photos | media; private unless `tiktokSettings.privacyLevel` |
| YouTube | 1 video, titled from the first line | media. MCP only: `youtubeSettings` title, privacy |
| Pinterest | 1 image or 1 MP4/MOV (an image with it is the cover), title from the first line | media, `pinterestBoardId`; `pinterestLink` optional |
| X | text, up to 4 images, 1 GIF or 1 video | |
| LinkedIn | text, 1 image or 1 MP4, 2 to 20 photos (sent as a PDF carousel), or a PDF URL as a document | personal profiles only |
| Facebook | text, up to 10 photos or 1 video | Pages |
| Threads | text, 1 image or 1 video | |
| Bluesky | text up to 300 characters, up to 10 images or 1 video | |
| Reddit | first line = title; text post, or a link post to the image | `redditSubreddit`, `redditFlairText` when the subreddit requires one |
| Telegram | text, or 1 photo or video with a caption | |
| Discord | text with up to 4 images | |
| Slack | text with up to 10 JPG/PNG/GIF photos; a video or WebP goes as a link | |
| Mastodon | text (500 characters on most servers), up to 4 photos or 1 video | |
| WordPress | a post titled from the first line; the first photo is the featured image | |

Write each network's text to its limits yourself: one `create_post` sends the same text everywhere, so make separate calls when X needs a shorter version than LinkedIn.

## 3. After posting

- `list_posts` (`status`: draft, scheduled, published, failed) shows what's queued. A failed post carries the network's reason in `error`: fix the cause, then `update_post` with a time (`publishNow`, `useNextSlot` or `scheduledAt`) retries it.
- `update_post` edits a draft, scheduled or failed post; only the fields sent change. `draft: true` pulls a scheduled post back. Published posts can't be edited.
- `delete_post` cancels a scheduled post. It never deletes what's already on the network.
- Numbers: `get_post_metrics` (one Breakreach post), `get_content_performance` (every post of the accounts, sortable), `get_post_insights` (everything about one post), `get_account_stats`, `get_account_trends`, `get_analytics`.

## 4. Comments, DMs, Comment to DM

- `list_recent_comments`, `get_post_comments`, then `reply_to_comment`, `hide_comment`, `delete_comment`, with the `accountId`, `platform` and `commentId` they return (Instagram, Facebook, Threads, X).
- `list_conversations`, `get_conversation_messages`, `send_message` (Instagram, Facebook Messenger, X). Instagram and Messenger accept replies within 24 hours of the person's last message.
- Comment to DM (Instagram): `create_comment_dm_rule` sends a DM to everyone who comments a keyword on a post (or every post), with `{username}` in the text; one DM per person per rule, within 7 days of the comment. `list_comment_dm_rules` shows what they sent; `update_comment_dm_rule` with `active: false` pauses one.
- Before replying or messaging on the user's behalf, show the text unless they already gave it or asked you to answer on your own.

## 5. Examples

**"Schedule this launch photo on Instagram and LinkedIn for tomorrow 9am"** (the workspace is in Europe/Paris, today is Monday 19 October 2026)

```
list_accounts → instagram (northbeam.coffee) 6701…c5, linkedin (Northbeam Coffee) 6701…c6
upload_media { url: "https://example.com/launch.jpg" } → https://…/launch.jpg
create_post {
  content: "Meet Morning Light, our new blend. Out tomorrow.",
  accountIds: ["6701…c5", "6701…c6"],
  media: ["https://…/launch.jpg"],
  scheduledAt: "2026-10-20T09:00:00",
  idempotencyKey: "2b6f0d3e-6a4f-4c2a-9a59-1f3c5d7e8a90"
}
→ Scheduled for Tuesday 20 October, 9:00 (Paris) on Instagram and LinkedIn.
```

**"Post this thread starter on X and Bluesky now"**: `list_accounts`, then one `create_post` with both ids and `publishNow: true` (text under 300 characters for Bluesky).

**"Queue these 5 tips for the next free slots"**: one `create_post` per tip with `useNextSlot: true`, each with its own `idempotencyKey`, then list the five times back.

**From a terminal or CI:**

```bash
npx breakreach post "Release 2.4 is out: faster exports." --to x,linkedin --next-slot --json
npx breakreach post "Behind the scenes" --to instagram --media ./roastery.jpg --at 2026-10-21T18:00
```

## 6. Errors

| Answer | Meaning | Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | missing, wrong or expired key or sign-in | reconnect the MCP server, or check `BREAKREACH_API_KEY` |
| 402 / "no active plan" | no plan or trial | give the user the link from the answer |
| 400 | a field is wrong; the message says which (missing media, an account outside the workspace, no time) | fix it, or ask the user |
| 404 "No free slot" / "No posting schedule" | the schedule is full or empty | use `scheduledAt`, or ask the user to add slots in Breakreach |
| 409 | the same idempotency key is still running | wait a few seconds, retry with the same key |
| 422 | that idempotency key was used for a different post | new post, new key |
